# Goals
Create a console version of the C++ CNN for MNIST.
Show image and results using ascii only.
Served as C/C++ programmer playing ground for CNN.
Expand the program to using multi-cores (CPU) and NVIDIA GPU (RTX3070)
Explore new ways for the CNN. (current model is slow and chunky. we should have smart ways to do it, like mask, sliding, etc..)
